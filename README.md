## Java 8 streams

This is a multi-module that uses jdk 7 & 8. Users of this repo can see clearly what features do not exist in Java 7. 
Examples are done in both modules to show different approaches to the same problem. A more detailed example involving 
an ArtistService is also included. This example demonstrates an easier way to iterate and manipulate collections of data 
using streams.

Requirements:

You need JDK 7 and 8 to run this project.
You must alter the module JDK versions in the project structure.
